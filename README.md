# Shortest Path Problem on Affine Subspaces

The goal of this project is to find the shortest path between two points in $\mathbb{R}^n$, while staying on affine subspaces given as data. For this, we use graphs of convex sets, as introduced in [Tobia Marcucci](https://tobiamarcucci.github.io/)'s [thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/156598).

A theoretical description of the project is available in the [`report`](./report) directory. The [`SPP`](./SPP) directory contains an implementation of the project in the [Julia Language](https://julialang.org/).
