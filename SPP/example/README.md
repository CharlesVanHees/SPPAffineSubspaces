# Shortest Path Problem on Affine Subspaces - Examples

This directory contains examples how to use the implementation of the Shortest Path Problem (SPP) on Affine Subspaces (AS) available [here](../src/).

Three examples are provided, one for the SPP in a classical graph in the file [`SPP_example.jl`](./SPP_example.jl), one for the SPP on AS, considering the AS as the vertices, in the file [`SPP_intersections_vertices_example.jl`](./SPP_intersections_vertices_example.jl), and one for the SPP on AS, considering the AS as the edges, in the file [`SPP_intersections_edges_example.jl`](./SPP_intersections_edges_example.jl). Those contains examples on how to generate AS, problem instances and graphs.
